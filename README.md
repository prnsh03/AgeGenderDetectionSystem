# CodeClauseIntern_Age-Gender-Detection-System

This project is about a detection system that predicts the age and gender of a person.

Gender-Age Detection System is a deep learning system.
Key components: Image dataset, Data Preprocessing, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Model training, Callbacks, Prediction, and visualization.

This Model is at its elementary level, we can integrate the model into real-time applications such as video analysis and security systems for immediate detection is a key avenue for improvement. Moreover, enhancing user experience by incorporating the system into user-facing applications for personalized content recommendations represents another promising direction for development.
